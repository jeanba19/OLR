# OLR


We present the different solutions OLR, OLR-SO, OLR-MTS and OLR-SO-MTS of the Chapter 4.

These solutions assist the SP in its online reservation policy of network resources that constitute the slice dedicated to its service.

These solutions are primal-dual type of algorithm used to solve the online optimization problem faced by the SP at each period.
